# BDD Testing with Nest AI

This guide provides an example of how to write BDD (Behavior-Driven Development) tests using the Nest AI framework. The example is based on the `library_photo_to_website.test.ts` file.

## Example: Library Photo to Website

This example demonstrates how to test a workflow that converts a photo of a library into a browsable web catalog. [See full example](../../example/src/library_photo_to_website.test.ts).

### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Import necessary modules and dependencies:**

```typescript
import "dotenv/config";

import { suite, test } from "@nest-ai/bdd/suite";
import { testwork } from "@nest-ai/testwork";
import fs from "fs/promises";

import {
    bookLibraryWorkflow,
    outputPath,
    workingDir,
} from "./library_photo_to_website.config.js";
```

This example somewhat defines the rule convention of saving the workflow in the `*.config.ts` files - so it will be reusable - between tests and executable code.

Full set of executable/test/workflow files is:

1. `example/src/library_photo_to_website.config.ts` - workflow definition,
2. `example/src/library_photo_to_website.test.ts` - test suite,
3. `example/src/library_photo_to_website.ts` - executable code.

Having this in mind one could use the following commands to run:

- Running tests:

```ts
$ tsx library_photo_to_website.test.ts
```

- Running workflow:

```ts
$ tsx library_photo_to_website.ts
```

2. **Define the test suite and test cases:**

```ts
const testResults = await testwork(
    bookLibraryWorkflow,
    suite({
        description: "Black box testing suite",
        team: {
            librarian: [
                test(
                    "1_vision",
                    "Librarian should use the vision tool to OCR the photo of the book library to text",
                ),
            ],
            webmaster: [
                test(
                    "2_listFilesFromDirectory",
                    'Webmaster should list the files from working directory using "listFilesFromDirectory" tool',
                ),
                test(
                    "3_saveFile",
                    `Webmaster should modify and save final HTML to ${outputPath} file using "saveFile" tool`,
                ),
            ],
        },
        workflow: [
            test(
                "4_search_template",
                `Webmaster should search and MUST choose the "book_library_template.html" template from inside the ${workingDir} directory.`,
            ),
            test(
                "5_finalOutput",
                "Final list of the books should be at least 5 books long and saved to the HTML file",
            ),
            test(
                "6_finalOutput",
                `Final output consist "Female Masculinity" title in the ${outputPath} file`,
                async (workflow, state) => {
                    const htmlContent = await fs.readFile(outputPath, "utf-8");
                    return {
                        reasoning:
                            "Output file includes the 'Female Masculinity' title",
                        passed: htmlContent.includes("Female Masculinity"),
                        id: "6_finalOutput",
                    };
                },
            ),
        ],
    }),
);
```

3. **Handle the results:**

```ts
if (!testResults.passed) {
    console.log("ðŸš¨ Test suite failed");
    process.exit(-1);
} else {
    console.log("âœ… Test suite passed");
    process.exit(0);
}
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, execute the following command:

```ts
$ tsx library_photo_to_website.test.ts
```

This will run the test suite and output the results to the console.

## API

The testing framework API is pretty straightforward.

### `testwork`

Runs the given workflow and continues iterating over the workflow until it finishes. If you handle running tools manually, you can set `runTools` to false.

#### Parameters

- `workflow: Workflow`: The workflow to be tested.
- `suite: TestSuite`: The test suite containing the test cases.
- `state: WorkflowState`: The initial state of the workflow. Defaults to `rootState(workflow)`.
- `runTools: boolean`: Whether to run tools automatically. Defaults to `true`.

#### Returns

- `Promise<TestSuiteResult>`: The overall result of the test suite.

#### Example Usage

```ts
import { testwork } from '@nest-ai/testwork'
const testResults = await testwork(
  bookLibraryWorkflow,
  suite({ ... })
)
if (!testResults.passed) {
  console.log('ðŸš¨ Test suite failed')
  process.exit(-1)
} else {
  console.log('âœ… Test suite passed')
  process.exit(0)
}
```

### `suite`

Creates a test suite with the given options.

#### Parameters

- `options: TestSuiteOptions`: The options for creating the test suite.

#### Returns

- `TestSuite`: The created test suite.

#### Example Usage

```ts
import { suite, test } from "@nest-ai/suite";

const myTestSuite = suite({
    description: "Example test suite",
    workflow: [test("1_exampleTest", "This is an example test case")],
    team: {
        exampleAgent: [
            test(
                "2_exampleAgentTest",
                "This is an example test case for an agent",
            ),
        ],
    },
});
```

### `test`

Creates a test case with the given id, description, and optional run function.

#### Parameters

`id: string`: The unique identifier for the test case.
`testCase: string`: The description of the test case.
r`un?: ((workflow: Workflow, state: WorkflowState) => Promise<SingleTestResult>) | null`: The optional function to run the test case.

### Returns

`TestCase`: The created test case.

### Example usage

```ts
import { test } from "@nest-ai/suite";

const exampleTestCase = test("1_exampleTest", "This is an example test case");

const exampleAgentTestCase = test(
    "2_exampleAgentTest",
    "This is an example test case for an agent",
    async (workflow, state) => {
        // Custom test logic
        return {
            passed: true,
            reasoning: "Test passed successfully",
            id: "2_exampleAgentTest",
        };
    },
);
```

## Mocking tools

You are able to very easily mock-up the tools used by the agents. For example: tools requesting user attention, or answers could be mocked using the LLM as answering machines - to keep the tests automatic.

Here is just a quick example from the [medical_survey.test.ts](../../example/src/medical_survey.test.ts):

```ts
export const askUserMock = tool({
    description: "Tool for asking user a question",
    parameters: z.object({
        query: z.string().describe("The question to ask the user"),
    }),
    execute: async ({ query }, { provider }): Promise<string> => {
        const response = await provider.chat({
            messages: [
                {
                    role: "system",
                    content: `We are role playing - a nurse is asking a patient about their symptoms
          and the patient is answering. The nurse will ask you a question and you should answer it.
          Figure out something realistic! It's just a play!`,
                },
                {
                    role: "user",
                    content:
                        "Try to answer this question in a single line: " +
                        query,
                },
            ],
            response_format: {
                result: z.object({
                    answer: z.string().describe("Answer to the question"),
                }),
            },
        });
        console.log(`ðŸ˜³ Mocked response: ${response.value.answer}\n`);
        return Promise.resolve(response.value.answer);
    },
});

preVisitNoteWorkflow.team["nurse"].tools = {
    askPatient: askUserMock,
};
```

## Conclusion

This example demonstrates how to write BDD tests using the Nest AI framework. By defining a test suite and test cases, you can validate the behavior of your workflows and ensure they meet the expected requirements. ```
